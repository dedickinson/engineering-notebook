= 2015-11-08 - Creating a base box

I've been working with Packer to create a base CentOS 7 box for use with Vagrant. The goal is to create an end-to-end
deployment using only automation - essentially allowing everything being rebuildable via source code.

I'd also like to setup a test suite for the base image using http://serverspec.org/[Serverspec]

See `/packer/base-centos/`.
