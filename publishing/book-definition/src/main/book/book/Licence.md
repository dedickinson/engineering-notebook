## Your Rights and This Book
I'm making the "Groovy Tutorial" freely available because I feel that open source projects such as Groovy deserve to have a variety of documentation that helps people use open source software. This body of work is one that took a significant amount of unpaid time but I have benefitted from many people's work in developing open source software and the associated, freely available text, that they make available. 

This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) - this means that you have the right to share and adapt the text as you see fit *but* you must give me _"appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use"_. If you decide to use the whole text or parts thereof in a manner that derives you an income I think it'd be civil of you to consider contributing to my retirement fund.

I don't provide any warranties, guarantees or  certainties[^note]. You should use this text to help you in your Groovy coding but you are responsible for your journey :)
