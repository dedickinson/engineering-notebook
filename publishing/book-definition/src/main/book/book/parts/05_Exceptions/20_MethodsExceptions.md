The code in this chapter is rather skewed as we'd rarely throw an exception and catch it within the same `try-catch` block. Rather, we're most likely to throw an exception from a method back to the caller and we use `try` blocks to catch exceptions from methods we're calling.

Throwing an exception from a method results in no `return` value being returned to the caller - the caller needs to handle the exception. It's important to note that, where the `try` and/or `catch` block contain a `return` statement, the `finally` block will be evaluated __before__ the `return` is actually processed. In the next two examples below, the `println` in the `finally` block will always display.

Using `return` in `catch`:

```groovy
def testMethod() {
    try {
        10 / 0
    } catch (any) {
        return
    } finally {
        println 'Finally block has been evaluated'
    }
}
```

Using `return` in `try`:

```groovy
def testMethod() {
    try {
        return 100
    } catch (any) {
        println 'Exception'
    } finally {
        println 'Finally block has been evaluated'
    }
}

testMethod()
```

We're about to get to the tutorial on Methods.
