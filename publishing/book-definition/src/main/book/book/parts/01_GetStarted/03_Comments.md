description:	Comments are used to clarify sections of Groovy code. Groovy supports two types of comments - single line and multi-line.  
...
Comments are read by the Groovy compiler - they're purely used to help humans follow your code. They're really important once your code becomes more complex and your programs larger. Key places you'll see/use comments are:

1. When a complex algorithm is being used
2. When specific business logic is being implemented
2. For documenting interfaces that other coders will use
3. To remind you why you chose one approach over another - really handy when you revisit the code in 6-weeks and say "why did I do it that way?".

# Single-line comments
A single-line comment is introduced with two forward slash characters `//`:

```groovy
//This is a single-line comment
println "hello, world"
```
    
Single-line comments can be appended to a Groovy statement:

    def radius = 10
    def pi = 3.14 //This is not very precise
    def area = pi * (radius * radius)

# Multi-line comments
    
A multi-line comment is introduced by the characters `/*` and terminated with the characters `*/`. Generally, the `/*` and `*/` appear on their own line:

```groovy
/*
This is a multiline comment
and here is the second line
*/
```

Multi-line comments are most commonly formatted with an asterisk (`*`) on each line, aligned with the introductory asterisk as follows:

```groovy
/*
 * This is a multiline comment
 * and here is the second line
 */
```

Multi-line comments can be introduced and terminated on a single line:

```groovy
/* This is a multiline comment on a single line */
```

Nesting within a multi-line comment is not possible, rendering the following code invalid:

```groovy
/*
 * Multi-line comments cannot 
 * /* be nested */
 */
```
    
# Usage to avoid    
In a similar vein to single-line comments, multi-line comments can be appended to a statement. However, the single-line comment is generally more readable than the following example:

```groovy
def radius = 10
def pi = 3.14 /* This is not very precise */
def area = pi * (radius * radius)
```

Even less expected is a multi-line comment appended to a statement in the following manner:

```groovy
def radius = 10
def pi = 3.14 /* This is not very precise
                and should really use java.lang.Math.PI */
def area = pi * (radius * radius)
```
    
In such a case the multi-line comment should appear above the statement being discussed:

```groovy
def radius = 10
/*
 * This is not very precise
 * and should really use java.lang.Math.PI
*/
def pi = 3.14 
def area = pi * (radius * radius)    
```
    
Use of a comment within a statement should never be contemplated as it results in code that is hard to read:

```groovy
    def radius = 10
    def pi = 3.14
    def area = pi * /* I should find out how to square */ (radius * radius)
```

# Groovydoc

Java provides a very handy tool for documenting the outward-facing aspects of your code - i.e. those items that others may reuse  - it's called javadoc[^javadoc]. Groovy has its own version called `groovydoc`. Essentially this is the same tool as `javadoc` but is run over groovy code. I won't go into `groovydoc` now - it'll come up when we explore object-oriented programming.
