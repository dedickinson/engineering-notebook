... 

Just like methods, closures can return a value. In fact both closures and methods always return a value.

In this next example, the result of the last expression is returned (the value of `num1` or `num2`):
 
```groovy
def max = { num1, num2 ->
    if (num1 >= num2) {
        num1
    } else if (num2 > num1) {
        num2
    } 
}

println max(14, 6)
```

Alternatively, we can use the `return` statement to explicitly exit the closure and return a value:

```groovy
def myClosure = { num1, num2 ->
    if (num1 >= num2) {
        return num1
    } else if (num2 > num1) {
        return num2
    } 
}

println myClosure(14, 6)
```

Unlike a method, closures can't explicitly define the data type of a return value. You might take a crack at `Integer maxNumber = {num1, num2 -> ...}` to set the return type but this statement won't work as `maxNumber` doesn't hold the result of the closure - it holds a reference to the closure.

`Closure myClosure = { num1, num2 -> ...}` will work as the `myClosure` variable is actually of the `Closure` data type.
