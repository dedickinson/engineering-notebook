Boolean variables are perhaps the simplest and can hold a value of either `true` or `false`.

```groovy
def truth = true
def lies = false
```

# Useful Methods

Booleans have a small number of methods that you generally won't find yourself using as they (mostly) have equivalent operators that are more "natural" to read and write.

The `and(right)` method performs a logical 'and'

```groovy  
def truth = true
def lies = false
assert truth.and(lies) == false 
```

The conditional And operator (`&&`) is equivalent to the `and` method and the assertion above could also be written as `assert truth && lies == false`

The `or(right)` method performs a logical 'or'

```groovy  
def truth = true
def lies = false
assert truth.or(lies) == true 
```

The conditional Or operator (`||`) is equivalent to the `or` method and the assertion above could also be written as `assert truth || lies == true`
