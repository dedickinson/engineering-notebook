There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around
That the colt from old Regret had got away,
And had joined the wild bush horses â€” he was worth a thousand pound,
So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.
All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far
Had mustered at the homestead overnight,
For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,
And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.
