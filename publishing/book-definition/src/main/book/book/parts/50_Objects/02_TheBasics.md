description:	At its core, Groovy is an object-oriented programming language. 
            This section introduces a range of object-oriented terminology and 
            provides you with a set of resources that will help you really hone
            those object-oriented programming skills.

Object-oriented programming is often referred to by its acronym "OO" or "OOP" and has been around for some time. We won't delve into history here - check the [Further reading][] section if you'd like to learn more. For now though, let's describe the essentials of OOP.

The object-oriented programming approach models concepts based on a combination of *properties* and *methods*. The concept being modelled may be a real-world entity such as a person, a car or a tree. It may also be a "virtual" concept such as a bank account, an HTTP server or a sales report.

The properties of an object (also referred to as fields) hold data that is important to the object's *state* 

Methods (less often referred to as functions) provide a means of accessing and manipulating the object's properties and behaviours. *Encapsulation* is an important concept in OOP and relates to the use of methods to hide and even protect an object's properties from direct access. Essentially, other code interacts with the object via its methods - often referred to as its interface. 

# Classes
Object-oriented programmers use *classes* to classify objects. As such, a class defines the fields (properties) and methods of an

In Groovy the `class` keyword if used when declaring a new class:

```
class Person {}
```

The definition of the `Person` class now provides the programmer with an new reference type

Objects consist of data and methods for interacting with that data. For example, the code below describes a `Person` class with a `name` field and a `getName` method:

```
class Person {
    def name
    
    def getName() {
        return this.name
    }
}
```

In order to create an instance of the `Person` class we use the `new` keyword and assign the result to a variable

```
def john = new Person(name: 'John')
println john.getName()
```
The call to `new Person(â€¦)` is actually using a special method called a "constructor". Classes can define a variety of constructors to help with creating an instance and Groovy has some handy tricks we'll explore later.

Instead of using the `def` keyword the variable could be declared as being of the `Person` type:

```
Person john = new Person(name: 'John')
```

#Interfaces
*Interfaces* provide a method for defining programming interfaces. 

The example below defines an interface named `exercise` with a single method `run`:

```
class Person {
    def name
}

interface Exercise {
    def run(int distance)
}

class Athlete extends Person implements Exercise {
    def run(int distance) {
        println "I'm off for a ${distance}km run."
    }
}

def robert = new Athlete(name: 'Rob')
robert.run(10)
```

# Packages
Groovy allows programmers to group objects into `packages`. In the following snippet the `Person` class is allocated to the `myobjects` package:

```
package myobjects

class Person {}
```


Packages are central to using others' code in your programs and 


#Inheritance
A *superclass* is one that other classes inherit from. These "child" classes are referred to as being *subclasses* and 

Unlike some other OO languages (e.g. C++), Groovy does not support multiple inheritance. This means that a class cannot extend more than one superclass. However, Groovy classes can implement more than one interface.


```
class StaffMember extends Person {
    def staffID
    
    def getIdentification() {
        println "${this.name} - ${this.staffID}"
    }
}
```


```
def sally = new StaffMember(name: 'Sally', staffID: 765)
sally.getIdentification()
```

# Traits


```groovy
class ProjectMethod {
}

trait Agile {
    def iterationLength = 4
    def backlog = [:]
    def developmentTeam = []
    
    
}

class Scrum
    extends ProjectMethod 
    implements Agile {

    def productOwner
    def scrumMaster
}
```

## Summary
This section has provided a brief overview of object-oriented programming supported by small examples. The rest of this chapter will dive far deeper into how to get OO with Groovy.
