description:	Working with Lists and Maps is made easier with these handy operators.
...

A number of operators are provided for working with Lists and Maps. Some overload operators such as `+` and `<<` whilst others (such as `in`) are more collection-oriented. Certain operators work with both Lists and Maps whilst others apply to only one.

|Operator(s)     |Type
|:------------------:|:--------------------|  
| `in`	| Membership Operator	|
| `<<`	| Append operator	|  
| `+`	| Addition operator	|  
| `-`	| Subtraction operator	|  
| `+=` `-=`	| Compound assignment operators	|   
| `*`	| Spread Operator	|  
| `*.`	| Spread-Dot Operator	|  
| `..`	| Range Operator	|  
| `[]`	| Subscript Operator	| 

This chapter won't discuss the following operators as they've been described earlier:

- The Range operator creates a list of sequential values and is usually seen with numbers. This is how we created Ranges in the tutorial on Variables.
- The Subscript operator is used to access items in a List or a Map and this was also discussed in the tutorial on Variables.

To finish this chapter off I'll do a little bit of mucking around with set theory.

# Membership Operator (Lists and Maps)

The `in` operator is used to determine if an item is "in" a list or is a key in a map.

```groovy
assert 6 in [1, 2, 6, 9]
assert !(3 in [1, 2, 6, 9])
```

```groovy
def grades = ['Maths': 'A',
    'English': 'C',
    'Science': 'B'].asImmutable()

assert 'Science' in grades
assert !('French' in grades)
```

# Append (Lists and Maps)

The `<<` operator adds a new element to an existing list:

```groovy
def friends = ['Frank', 'Larry']
friends << 'Jane'
println friends
```

It's important to note that appending a list to a list will add a new element that contains the list in the right-hand operand:

```groovy
def friends = ['Frank', 'Larry']
friends << ['Jane', 'Greg']
assert friends == ['Frank', 'Larry', ['Jane', 'Greg']]
```

In order to add the individual items of one list to another I need to use the `addAll()` method:

```groovy
def friends = ['Frank', 'Larry']
friends.addAll(['Jane', 'Greg'])
assert friends == ['Frank', 'Larry', 'Jane', 'Greg']
```

>Also check out the Spread operator

I can also use `<<` to append a new key:value pair to a map:

```groovy
def grades = [:]
grades << ['Maths': 'A']
grades << ['English': 'C']
grades << ['Science': 'B']
println grades
```

If I was to add another line `grades << ['Science': 'F']` to the code above, the value for `Science` would be changed to `F` as the map's keys are unique.

# Addition (Lists and Maps)

The addition operator (`+`) returns a __*new*__ list with the right-hand operand added:

```groovy
def friends = ['Frank', 'Larry']
assert friends + 'Jane' == ['Frank', 'Larry', 'Jane']
```

>This is different to the append operation as the addition results in a new list whereas append adds to the existing list - we'll look into this when we get to compound assignment operators

When we add two lists together we get a union of the two lists returned:

```groovy
def friends = ['Frank', 'Larry']
assert friends + ['Jane', 'Greg'] == ['Frank', 'Larry', 'Jane', 'Greg']
```

>This is different to the `addAll()` method as a new list is returned rather than the items being added to the existing list.

Adding to a Set returns a set with the union sans any duplicates:

```groovy
def set = [2, 4, 6, 8] as Set
assert union + [8, 10] == [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] as Set
```

The addition operator will either add a key:value pair to a map or alter the value held against an existing key. In the example below I create a new map item with a result for my French class and then change an existing map item with a reduced English score:

```groovy
def grades = ['Maths': 'A',
    'English': 'C',
    'Science': 'B']

assert grades + ['French': 'F'] == ['Maths': 'A', 'English': 'C', 'Science': 'B', 'French': 'F']
assert grades + ['English': 'D'] == ['Maths': 'A', 'English': 'D', 'Science': 'B']
```

# Subtraction (Lists and Maps)

The subtraction (`-`) operator will return a __*new*__ list with an element removed _if_ the list contains the element:

```groovy
assert [2, 4, 6, 8] - 6 == [2, 4, 8]
```

A list can also be subtracted from a list, returning a new list containing items in the left-hand operand (`[2, 4, 6, 8]`) that are not in the right-hand operand (`[2, 6, 12]`):

```groovy
assert [2, 4, 6, 8] - [2, 6, 12] == [4, 8]
```

In the example below my attempt to remove `Gary` doesn't do anything as he's not in the list (this doesn't cause an exception) but I do succeed in un-friending `Frank`:

```groovy
def friends = ['Frank', 'Larry', 'Jane']
assert friends - 'Gary' == ['Frank', 'Larry', 'Jane']
assert friends - 'Frank' == ['Larry', 'Jane']
```

When subtraction is applied to a Map the right-hand operand needs to be a key:value pair. In the example below I attempt 3 things:

1. I attempt to remove `['English': 'D']` but it's not in `grades` so nothing happens
2. I attempt to remove `['French': 'F']` but it's not in `grades` so nothing happens
3. I attempt to remove `['English': 'C']` and __it is__ in `grades` so the removal occurs.

```groovy
def grades = ['Maths': 'A',
    'English': 'C',
    'Science': 'B']

assert grades - ['English': 'D'] == ['Maths': 'A', 'English': 'C', 'Science': 'B']
assert grades - ['French': 'F'] == ['Maths': 'A', 'English': 'C', 'Science': 'B']
assert grades - ['English': 'C'] == ['Maths': 'A', 'Science': 'B']
```

# Compound Assignment Operators (Lists and Maps)

Just as we saw with numbers, the addition and subtraction operators returns a value but don't actually change the variable involved in the operation. To change the value of `grades` I would have needed to assign the resultant back into the variable as follows:

```groovy
grades = grades + ['French': 'F'] 
assert grades  == ['Maths': 'A', 'English': 'C', 'Science': 'B', 'French': 'F']
```

If we want to use the `grades` variable as the left-hand operand and change its value we can use the compound assignment operators. This means I could also have written the previous example using the `+=` compound assignment:

```groovy
grades += ['French': 'F'] 
assert grades  == ['Maths': 'A', 'English': 'C', 'Science': 'B', 'French': 'F']
```

Using the append operator in its compound form (`<<=`) is redundant.

## Immutability and Assignment

Consider the following code and see if you're surprised:

```groovy
def grades = ['Maths': 'A',
    'English': 'C',
    'Science': 'B'].asImmutable()

grades += ['French': 'F'] 
assert grades  == ['Maths': 'A', 'English': 'C', 'Science': 'B', 'French': 'F']
```

Groovy let me change something that's immutable! I should go to the mailing list and report this! The outrage!

Hang on! What `asImmutable()` does is set the elements of the list to be unchangeable but it doesn't make the `grades` variable immutable. As the `+` operator actually returns a new list value, Groovy is correct in assigning that new value to `grades`. 

If I'd used `grades << ['French': 'F']` instead of grades += ['French': 'F'] I would get a `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` as I'm actually trying to add a new element to `grades`.

If I really want to make `grades` completely immutable (constant) then I'd need to use the `final` modifier and declare `grades` within a class. The code below demonstrates how I'd set up the class and ensure that attempts to change `grades` cause an exception:

```groovy
class Report {
    final grades = ['Maths': 'A',
        'English': 'C',
        'Science': 'B'].asImmutable()
}

def myReport = new Report()
myReport.grades += ['French': 'F'] 
```

Running the code above will earn you a `groovy.lang.ReadOnlyPropertyException`.

# Spread Operator (Lists)

The Spread operator extracts each element in the List into another list or a method's parameters. This is helpful when you need to include a list's individual items in another list or when your list can be used as parameters in a method call.

## Extracting Into Lists

In the first example, one lists's items are extracted into another list:

```groovy
def list = [1, 2, 6, 9]
def list2 = [*list, 12, 34]
assert list2 == [1, 2, 6, 9, 12, 34]
```

This usage looks rather like the `addAll()` method but you may need to be mindful as to the position in which the list is extracted. The example below uses `addAll()` but results in `list2` being ordered differently than in the previous example:

```groovy
def list = [1, 2, 6, 9]
def list2 = [12, 34]
list2.addAll(list)
assert list2 == [12, 34, 1, 2, 6, 9]
```

In this last example I demonstrate an easy approach to creating a union of the two lists:

```groovy
def list = [1, 2, 6, 9]
def list2 = [12, 34]
assert [*list, *list2] == [1, 2, 6, 9, 12, 34]
```

## Extracting as Parameters

In the next example I extract the items in the `score` list out, each aligning with the parameters in the 

```groovy
def mean(num1, num2, num3) {
  (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3
}
def scores = [4, 8, 3]
assert mean(*scores) == 5
```

That last example is a little bit of a goldilocks moment - I have exactly the same number of items in the list as the method has parameters. I also have a pretty limited version of the `mean` method - it only works on 3 numbers. However, a method with a varargs parameter is a little less fairy tale:

```groovy
def mean(...nums) {
  def total = 0
  for (item in nums) {
    total += item
  }
  return total / nums.size()
}

def scores = [4, 8, 3]
assert mean(*scores) == 5
```

One last example of using the spread operator:

```groovy
def buyGroceries(...items) {
    for (item in items) {
        println item
    }
}

def shoppingList = ['apples', 'cat food', 'cream']
buyGroceries(*shoppingList)
```

>Realistically, the `items` parameter is a list but it proves the point. We'll look into this type of method parameter in the tutorial on methods.

## Multiply Operator

Note that you can use `*` as a form of multiplication involving lists but this doesn't return a list containing each element multiplied by the right-hand operand. Rather, the returned list just contains the original list elements repeated by the number of times set by the right-hand operand. In the example below I get `2, 4, 6` repeated 4 times:

```groovy
def list = [2, 4, 6]
println list * 4
```

# Spread-Dot Operator (Lists)
The `*.` operator calls an action (method) on each item in the list and returns a new list containing the results. In the example below I call the `reverse()` method on each list element:

```groovy
println(['carrot', 'cabbage', 'cauliflower']*.reverse())
```

The spread operator mimics the `collect()` method - with the previous example being equivalent to the following:

```groovy
['carrot', 'cabbage', 'cauliflower'].collect{it?.reverse()}
```

The spread operator makes the method call using the "Safe navigation Operator" (`?.`) to make sure that the list element isn't null - refer to the Object Operators section for more information. In the next example I include a `null` in the list and the returned list features the `null`:

```groovy
println(['carrot', 'cabbage', null, 'cauliflower']*.reverse())
```

For maps I can't use `*.` so need to use the `collect()` method.

# A Little Set Theory

Writing this chapter got me thinking about [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) and how various aspects can be achieved in Groovy lists.

## Membership

The `in` method gives us a membership check:

```groovy
assert 4 in [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## Union

The addition operator provides us with the ability to performs unions:

```groovy
assert [2, 4, 6, 8] + [1, 3, 5, 7] == [2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7]
```

## Complements

The subtraction operator (`-`) gives us set complement (difference):

```groovy
assert [2, 4, 6, 8] - [6, 8, 10] == [2, 4]
```

## Intersection

The `disjoint()` method will return `true` if two lists don't contain any intersecting elements:

```groovy
assert [2, 4, 6, 8].disjoint([1, 3, 5, 7]) == true
```

If `disjoint()` returns `false` then some elements intersect.

```groovy
def list1 = [2, 4, 6, 8]
def list2 = [6, 8, 10]

assert ([*list1, *list2] as Set) - (list1 - list2) - (list2 - list1) == [6, 8] as Set
```

## Guava Sets Library

All this got me thinking further and looking into Google's Guava libraries - here's some code that uses Guava to scratch my set itch:

```groovy
@Grab(group='com.google.guava', module='guava', version='18.0')
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.*

def list1 = [2, 4, 6, 8] as Set
def list2 = [6, 8, 10] as Set

println "Intersection: " << intersection(list1, list2)
println "Union: " << union(list1, list2)
println "Difference (list1 - list2): " << difference(list1, list2)
println "Difference (list2 - list1): " << difference(list2, list1)

println "Cartesian product of list1 and list2"
for (set in cartesianProduct(list1, list2)) {
    println " - $set"
}

println "Powersets of list1: " 
for (set in powerSet(list1)) {
    println " - $set"
}
```
