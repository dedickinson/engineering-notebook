description:	Groovy provides a very handy set of operators for working with Strings.
...

You'll spend a lot of your career manipulating strings so anything that makes them less of a hassle is nice. Groovy helps you with the following operators overloaded for your string work.

|Operator(s)       |Type
|:-------------------:|:-----------| 
|`+`, `<<`	| Concatenate Operator	|   
|`<<=` `+=`	| Append Operator	|  
|`-`	| Remove Operator	| 
|`-=`	| Remove In-place Operator	|  
|`*`	| Repeat Operator	|  
|`*=`	| Repeat In-place Operator	|  
|`++` `--`	| Increment and Decrement Operators	|  

# Concatenate Operator

The concatenate operator joins two strings together:

```groovy
println  'It was the best of times.' << 'It was the worst of times.'
```

The above example is rather daft as we could have just put both strings together in the same set of quotes. You're more likely to see strings added to over the course of a program:

```groovy
def quote = 'It was the best of times.'
quote = quote << 'It was the worst of times.'
println quote
```

Instead of using the concatenate you could have just used string interpolation:

```groovy
def quote = 'It was the best of times.'
quote = "$quote It was the worst of times."
println quote
```

The `+` operator is used in the same manner as `<<`:

```groovy
def quote = 'It was the best of times.'
quote = quote + 'It was the worst of times.'
println quote
```

As you'll see in later in this chapter it's best to use `<<` over `+`

## Concatenation and Types

When you concatenate a string with a number Groovy will cast the number into a string. That means you can end up with 1 + 1 = 11 as the code below demonstrates:

```groovy
assert '1' + 1 == '11'
assert 1 + '1' == '11'
```

If you're really wanting to add a string to a number you need to make sure you explicitly turn the string into a number:

```groovy
assert '1'.toInteger() + 1 == 2
```

This may all sound a bit odd now but if you're trying to work out why your program's maths seems all wrong it's worth looking into where strings and numbers are being mashed together.

# Append Operator

The append operator (`<<=`) conflates the assignment (`=`) and concatenate operators:

```groovy
def quote = 'It was the best of times.'
quote <<= 'It was the worst of times.'
println quote
```

This saves you from having to use `quote = quote << 'It was the worst of times.'`

>`+=` also appends but don't use it - you'll see why in a moment.

# Remove Operator

The remove operator (`-`) removes the first instance of a string or regular expression from another string. The easiest form just removes the first instance of a specific string - in the case of the example below, 'of ' is removed:

```groovy
quote = 'It was the worst of times.' - 'of '
println quote
```

The example above will display `It was the worst times.`

A regular expression pattern can also be used if you want to use a pattern. In the example below, the first occurrence of "bat" or "rat" is removed, resulting in `cat  rat monkey` (_note the double space_)

```groovy
println 'cat bat rat monkey' - ~/[br]at/
```

# Remove In-Place Operator

Works just like the remove operator (`-`) but does the match to the variable as well as modifying it. As for the first remove example, a string can be provided for removal:

```groovy
quote = 'It was the worst of times.'
quote -= 'of '
println quote
```

...and it can also use patterns: 

```groovy
def str = 'cat bat rat monkey'
str -= ~/[br]at/
println str
```

# Repeat Operator

This is a great operator for those that love repetition! Let's print out `hello` ten-times, each time one a new line:

```groovy
print 'hello\n' * 10
```

# Repeat In-PlaceOperator

This one applies the mutliplier against the variable and stores the result back in the variable:

```groovy
def complaint = 'ow'
complaint *= 10
println complaint
```

I'll leave it to you to see what happens :)

# Increment and Decrement Operators

The increment operator will move the last character of the string to its next value:

```groovy
def str = 'hello'
str++
assert str == 'hellp'
```

The increment/decrement actually works across the Unicode character codes[^unicode] so don't expect code to just use 'a' to 'z':

```groovy
def str = 'fo%'
str--
assert str == 'fo$'
```

For a small experiment, try the following code - it will display a subset of the Unicode characters:

```groovy
//\u00A1 is the Unicode character for an inverted exclamation mark
def chr = '\u00A1'
for (i in 161..191) {
    println chr
    chr++
}
```

I'm sure that this is useful somewhere.....

# Warning: Strings Are Expensive!

Many programs build strings up over the course of their operation. This can start becoming very expensive in terms of program resources such as memory because, without the correct approach, the JVM has to copy strings to new memory locations each time you use concatenation.

Java developers turn to the `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` classes to make their string building more efficient. Groovy developers using dynamic types can use a few tricks to stay dynamic and ensure efficiency.

Let's take a look at two approaches to building a string. In the first example I'll use the `+=` operator and perform 1000 concatenations:

```groovy
import java.text.DecimalFormat

def quote = 'It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.\n'

def str = ""

def startTime = System.nanoTime()
1000.times {
    str += quote
}
def endTime = System.nanoTime()

DecimalFormat formatter = new DecimalFormat("#,###")
def duration = formatter.format(endTime - startTime)

println "That took $duration nano seconds"
```

>Timing in this manner isn't perfect as you won't get the same answer each time you run the script. However, you should notice a significant different between the two examples - enough to indicate that the second version is much more efficient.

In the next example I'll change just 1 thing: I'll use the `<<=` operator rather than `+=`:

```groovy
import java.text.DecimalFormat

def quote = 'It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.\n'

def str = ""

def startTime = System.nanoTime()
1000.times {
    str <<= quote
}
def endTime = System.nanoTime()

DecimalFormat formatter = new DecimalFormat("#,###")
def duration = formatter.format(endTime - startTime)

println "That took $duration nano seconds"
```

When I run these scripts in groovyConsole I can see that the results are very different. When I ran each test 100 times and averaged the result I got:

* Example 1 (using `+=`): 24,215,520 ns
* Example 2 (using `<<=`): 191,490 ns

To me this is evidence enough for me to use '<<=' over `+=`!

# Templates

If you find yourself building strings around boilerplate text - such as a form letter - consider using Groovy's templating system. We'll look at templates in their own tutorial.
