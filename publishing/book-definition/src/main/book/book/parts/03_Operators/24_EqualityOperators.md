...

The equality operators return a boolean (`true` or `false`) result from a comparison. 

[Table: The equality operators]
|Operator|Name     
|:------:|:--------
|==      |Equal to 
|!=      |Not equal to

All of the following comparisons evaluate as being `true`:

```groovy
assert -99 == -99
assert 'koala' == 'koala'
assert 'cat' != 'dog'
assert 6 != 7

def domesticAnimal = 'dog'
def wildAnimal = 'lion'
assert domesticAnimal != wildAnimal

def str1 = 'Hello'
def str2 = 'Hello'
assert str1 == str2
```

# What Is Equality?

Equality can be a little tricky - both for Groovy and humanity. Think about the statement "Hey cool, we have the same car!". This could mean that we have the same make and model but different instances of a car *or* it could mean that we share a car. 

For those coming from a Java background, `==` is used to determine if the two variables reference the same instance and the `equals` method is used to determine if two variables are equivalent. Groovy conflates `==` and `equals` to perform the same comparison.

The `is` method performs the Groovy equivalent of Java's `==` and returns `true` if two variables refer to the same instance of an object

```groovy
def obj1 = new Object()
def obj2 = new Object()
def obj3 = obj1

assert obj1.is(obj3)
assert ! obj1.is(obj2)

assert obj1 != obj2
assert obj1 == obj3

assert ! obj1.equals(obj2)
assert obj1.equals(obj3)
```

# Precedence
In the following example, the equality operator (`!=`) is evaluated before the assignment operator (`=`), resulting in the value of `truth` being the boolean value `true`:

```groovy
def truth = 'cats' != 'dogs'
assert truth == true
```

# Overloading Equality

It is possible to define a custom implementation of `==` by overriding the `equals(Object obj)` method. This can be handy if your object has a simple method for determining equality, such as comparing staff members by their ID:

```groovy
class StaffMember {
    def id
    
    @Override
    boolean equals(obj) {
        if (this.id == obj.id) {
            return true
        } else {
            return false 
        }
    }
}

def fred = new StaffMember(id: 12)
def jan = new StaffMember(id: 47)
def janet = new StaffMember(id: 47)

assert fred != jan
assert jan == janet
``` 

The Groovy package `groovy.transform` provides a handy annotation that generates an `equals` implementation which compares the object's properties. This reduces the previous `StaffMember` class to even fewer lines of code:

```groovy
@groovy.transform.EqualsAndHashCode
class StaffMember {
    def id
}

def fred = new StaffMember(id: 12)
def jan = new StaffMember(id: 47)
def janet = new StaffMember(id: 47)

assert fred != jan
assert jan == janet
```

>The `HashCode` aspect to the annotation indicates that the `hashCode` method is overridden. This method generates a hash code[^hash] that aids in identifying an instance of the class.
