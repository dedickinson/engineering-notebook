title:	Control Flow Statements  
status:	draft
description:	Control flow statements give code the power to go beyond top-to-bottom execution of statements.  
...

Most code needs to reflect a decision-making process. A decision may be an either-or in which we process one set of statements rather than another. Another decision may be to run the same set of statements for a finite (or infinite) period. 

Groovy supports a range of control-flow statements:

* The conditional statements:
	* `if` and `if-else`
	* `switch`
	* `try-catch-finally`
* The looping statements:
	* `for`
	* `for`-each
	* `while`
* The branching statements:
	* `break`
	* `continue`
	* `return`

This chapter will describe the conditional and looping statements and discuss how and where the `break` and `continue` branching statements fit in. 

The `try-catch-finally` statement will be explored in the "Exceptions" chapter.

The `return` statement will be explored in the "Methods and Closures" chapter.
