Generates a base image for CentOS

WARNING: This image does not aim to be secure.

== Backlog

Things left to-do:

* Lock out the `vagrant` user from console
* Use SCAP to check for any vulnerabilities....?


== Pre-requisites

. https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python] 3.5+
.. `python3 -m pip install passlib` (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25079290/crypt-does-not-work-in-osx-returns-wrong-value[needed as OS X version of `crypt()` doesn't work for this.])
. https://www.packer.io[Packer] 0.8+
. https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] 1.7+
.. Install the vagrant-scp plugin: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-scp`
.. And the Serverspec one: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-serverspec`
. https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] 5.0+

NOTE: I run on OS X and found I had to install Python 3 in order to generate hashes as I kept getting shortened output.

== Process

To create the images:

    ./build.sh

This will generate the various VirtualBox and Vagrant images. To try the Vagrant box:

    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp/
    vagrant init centos-7-base
    vagrant up

To clean up:

    ./clean.sh

Note that `packer_cache` is not deleted as otherwise you'd keep downloading the ISO.

=== Packer configuration
The packer config is found in `centos-7.json`

* I'm using the CentOS ISO at http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/centos/7/isos/x86_64/
** This URL also provides the checksum
* `"keep_input_artifact": true` is configured in the `post-processors` so that I can keep the OVF after packaging
** This is a VirtualBox appliance and is useful for "debugging" - you can open it in VBox's `File->Import Appliance` menu

=== Kickstart configuration

* `network`:
** I want to enable IPv6
* `selinux`:
** I want to use SELinux but, at an early stage will set this to `permissive`.
** After some testing I will enforce this using `enforcing`
* `rootpw`:
** Uses an encrypted password that was generated using `python3 -c 'from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt; print(sha512_crypt.encrypt("Root Password"))'`
** This could be changed to be secured to a corporate root password
* `user`:
** The vagrant user is created by Kickstart.
** Uses an encrypted password that was generated using `python3 -c 'from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt; print(sha512_crypt.encrypt("vagrant"))'`

NOTE: The `$6` in the encrypted password indicates that it's SHA512

In terms of baseline packages I really want this to be as minimal as possible. Checking out the http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/centos/7/os/x86_64/repodata/0e6e90965f55146ba5025ea450f822d1bb0267d0299ef64dd4365825e6bad995-c7-x86_64-comps.xml.gz[comps.xml] for the distro reveals the various environments available. I went with `@base` for minimalism but this isn't needed - it's always used.

=== SCAP

I'll use the general purpose RHEL 7 profile: http://static.open-scap.org/ssg-guides/ssg-rhel7-guide-index.html

To check out an installed guide, use

    mkdir results

    sudo oscap oval eval --results results/scan-oval-results.xml ssg-centos7-cpe-oval.xml
    oscap oval generate report results/scan-oval-results.xml > results/ssg-scan-oval-report.html

    sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_rht-ccp --results results/scan-xccdf-results.xml ssg-centos7-xccdf.xml
    oscap xccdf generate report results/scan-xccdf-results.xml > results/scan-xccdf-report.html

To copy the files to your host system (run in a terminal on your host):

    vagrant scp default:/home/vagrant/results/scan-xccdf-report.html ./
    vagrant scp default:/home/vagrant/results/ssg-scan-oval-report.html ./

== Knowledge-base

* The `packer build` fails with `centos7 error : sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo`
** Solution: Use `"ssh_pty": "true"` in `centos-7.json`
** Ref: https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/issues/1804
** Ref: https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/communicator.html#ssh_pty
* The `packer build` takes too long and times out
** Don't try to `yum update` in the kickstart `%post` section - leave that to provisioning
