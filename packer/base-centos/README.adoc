Generates a base Vagrant box for CentOS for both VirtualBox 5 and VMWare App Catalyst

WARNING: This image does not aim to be secure.


== PIVOT!

Decided to switch to a more declarative YAML-based config and try to build the smarts as Groovy. Check box.yaml

== Backlog

Things left to-do:

* Lock out the `vagrant` user from console
* Don't run as the user named `vagrant`, use `automator`
* Use SCAP to check for any vulnerabilities....?
* Get build to work with VMware's AppCatalyst

== Pre-requisites

. https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python] 3.5+
.. Install the `passlib` library `python3 -m pip install passlib`
... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25079290/crypt-does-not-work-in-osx-returns-wrong-value[needed as OS X version of `crypt()` doesn't work for this.]
. https://www.packer.io[Packer] 0.8+
. https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] 1.7+
.. (optional) Install the vagrant-scp plugin: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-scp`
.. And the Serverspec one: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-serverspec`
... Used to test the VM
. https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] 5.0+
.. I'm working with `5.0.10`
. https://www.vmware.com/cloudnative/appcatalyst-download[VMware AppCatalyst]

NOTE: I run on OS X and found I had to install Python 3 in order to generate encrypted passwords as I kept getting shortened output. You may not need Python + passlib if you're running on Linux.

Add the following line to your profile so as to centralise the packer cache

    export PACKER_CACHE_DIR="~/.packer_cache"

=== Generating passwords

    python3 -c 'from passlib import utils; print(utils.generate_password(size=42))'

=== Generate an SSH key

I don't want to use the default vagrant keys so create my own for use with Vagrant:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/vagrant

The Packer config (`centos-7.json`) will look for `~/.ssh/vagrant.pub` by default but this can be overridden when calling
packer by setting the `ssh_key` variable - you can see this being done in `build.sh`.

I'd strongly suggest setting a passphrase on the key - it's just good practice.

WARNING: Don't upload keys to Git or a publicly available system.

== Process

To create the images I build them in stages:

    ./build.sh base-virtualbox
    ./build.sh overlay-guest-build-virtualbox
    ./build.sh overlay-configure-virtualbox

This will generate the various VirtualBox and Vagrant images. To try the Vagrant box:

    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp/
    vagrant init centos-7-base
    vagrant up

To clean up:

    ./clean.sh

Note that `packer_cache` is not deleted as otherwise you'd keep downloading the ISO and guest additions.

=== Packer configuration
The packer config is found in `centos-7.json`

* I'm using the CentOS ISO at http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/centos/7/isos/x86_64/
** This URL also provides the checksum
* `"keep_input_artifact": true` is configured in the `post-processors` so that I can keep the OVF after packaging
** This is a VirtualBox appliance and is useful for "debugging" - you can open it in VBox's `File->Import Appliance` menu

==== Incremental builds

It can get very annoying starting from scratch whilst testing. Most Packer builders provide the ability to build off
an existing image, such as one created when you run `build.sh`. When testing I get that build done and then edit the
configuration for the incremental builder (e.g. `virtualbox-ovf`) and add extra scripts there.

    packer build -only=<builder> centos-7.json

=== Kickstart configuration

* `network`:
** I want to enable IPv6
* `selinux`:
** I want to use SELinux but, at an early stage will set this to `permissive`.
** After some testing I will enforce this using `enforcing`
* `rootpw`:
** Uses an encrypted password that was generated using `python3 -c 'from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt; print(sha512_crypt.encrypt("Root Password"))'`
** This could be changed to be secured to a corporate root password
* `user`:
** The vagrant user is created by Kickstart.
** Uses an encrypted password that was generated using `python3 -c 'from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt; print(sha512_crypt.encrypt("vagrant"))'`

See: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-kickstart-installations.html

NOTE: The `$6` in the encrypted password indicates that it's SHA512

In terms of baseline packages I really want this to be as minimal as possible. Checking out the http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/centos/7/os/x86_64/repodata/0e6e90965f55146ba5025ea450f822d1bb0267d0299ef64dd4365825e6bad995-c7-x86_64-comps.xml.gz[comps.xml] for the distro reveals the various environments available. I went with `@base` for minimalism but this isn't needed - it's always used.

=== SSHD

See `uploads/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

See: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/sshd_config.5?query=sshd_config&sec=5

=== sudoers

See `uploads/etc/sudoers`

See: http://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.13/sudoers.man.html

=== SCAP

I'll use the general purpose RHEL 7 profile: http://static.open-scap.org/ssg-guides/ssg-rhel7-guide-index.html

To check out an installed guide, use

    mkdir results

    sudo oscap oval eval --results results/scan-oval-results.xml ssg-centos7-cpe-oval.xml
    oscap oval generate report results/scan-oval-results.xml > results/ssg-scan-oval-report.html

    sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_rht-ccp --results results/scan-xccdf-results.xml ssg-centos7-xccdf.xml
    oscap xccdf generate report results/scan-xccdf-results.xml > results/scan-xccdf-report.html

To copy the files to your host system (run in a terminal on your host):

    vagrant scp default:/home/vagrant/results/scan-xccdf-report.html ./
    vagrant scp default:/home/vagrant/results/ssg-scan-oval-report.html ./

== Knowledge-base

* The `packer build` fails with `centos7 error : sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo`
** Solution 1: Use `"ssh_pty": "true"` in `centos-7.json`
*** Used for packer builds
*** Ref: https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/issues/1804
*** Ref: https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/communicator.html#ssh_pty
** Solution 2: Drop `requiretty` in `sudoers`
*** Configured during packer builds so that vagrant users don't see the problem or need to enable pty
* The `packer build` takes too long and times out
** Don't try to `yum update` in the kickstart `%post` section - leave that to provisioning
