#Overview


## Installation
On my local OS X machine I'll install:

- Ansible
- PostgreSQL
- ApacheDS
- dnsmasq: to provide a localised dns service

For most of these I'll use MacPorts

I'll also setup an NFS server on my laptop

I'll create a number of VMs:

- JiraConf: To host a Jira and Confluence instance
- GitLab: Hosting a GitLab service
- JenkinsSonar: Hosts a Jenkins CI server and a SonarQube system
